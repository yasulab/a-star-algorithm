A* Search Algorithm
============================

Description
-----------
This program implements the idea of A* algorithm
with following three heuristic functions:

- 1. Zero heuristic
- 2. Manhattan heuristic
- 3. Euclidean heuristic

In Zero heuristic, each space in a maze is equally cost,
so the next-exploring space totally depends on how spaces
are put into the queue. In this program, the spaces are
put into the queue in the way from top left to bottom right.
For example, if the program seeks the 3x3 map, it should put
as follows:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9


Manhattan heuristic calculates costs with Manhattan distance.
For example, in the following state, where the '*' is goal,
'x' is current location, and 'o' is the start, the cost
should be 4.

    * . .
    . x .
    . . o
    
In addition, if some elements in the queue has
same cost, the queue sorts them according to the sort of
Queue.PriorityQueue in Python library.

In particular, the priority queue sorts elements in the queue
by the ascend order of number x if given element's costs are
all same. Also, it sorts them by the ascend order of number y
if given element's costs and number of x are all same.


Euclidean heuristic calculates costs with Euclidean distance.
For example, in the following state, the cost should be 10.

f(x) = h(x) + g(x)
     = sqrt(3^2+4^2) + sqrt(4^2+3^2)
     = 5 + 5
     = 10

    * . . . . . . . .
    . . . . . . . . .
    . . . . . . . . .
    . . . . o . . . .
    . . . . . . . . .
    . . . . . . . . .
    . . . . . . . . x

So, using these heuristics, this program shows how A* algorithm
works step by step.



How To Run
----------
1. Get python 2.6 or higher

2. Type following command in your terminal.

  $ python main.py [options]

Options are not needed to run the program. But,
if you want to specify input files, heuristic
function, or make program display much information,
the following options will be useful.

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file=FILE  choose a formatted text file for creating a maze. This
                        program uses 'mazes/sample' by default.
  -H HEURISTICS         choose a heuristic function for A* algorithm from
     			'zero', 'manhattan', 'euclidean' (or it's abbreviations:
			'z', 'm', and 'e'). This option sets'zero' by default.
  -v, --verbose         display information verbosely.
  -d, --diagonal        switch to the program that allows diagonal travel for
                        a cost of 3, and horizontal/vertical motion costs 2.

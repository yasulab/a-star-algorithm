Description:
This program implements the idea of A* algorithm
with following three heuristic functions:

- 1. Zero heuristic
- 2. Manhattan heuristic
- 3. Euclidean heuristic

In Zero heuristic, each space in a maze is equally cost,
so the next-exploring space should be determined by the
definision of Queue.PriorityQueue in Python library.

The priority queue sorts elements in the queue by the
ascend order of number x if given element's costs are all
same. Also, it sorts them by the ascend order of number y
if given element's costs and number of x are all same.

Manhattan heuristic calculates costs with Manhattan distance.
For example, in the following state, where the '*' is goal,
'x' is current location, and 'o' is the start, the cost
should be 4.

    * . .
    . x .
    . . o
    
Same as Zero heuristic, if some elements in the queue has
same cost, the queue sorts them according to the sort of
Queue.PriorityQueue in Python library.

Euclidean heuristic calculates costs with Euclidean distance.
For example, in the following state, the cost should be 10.

    * . . . . . . . .
    . . . . . . . . .
    . . . . . . . . .
    . . . . o . . . .
    . . . . . . . . .
    . . . . . . . . .
    . . . . . . . . x


How To Run:
1. Get python 2.6 or higher

2. Type following command in your terminal.

  $ python main.py [options]

Options are not needed to run the program. But,
if you want to specify input files, heuristic
function, or make program display much information,
the following options will be useful.

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file=FILE  choose a formatted text file for creating a maze. This
                        program uses 'mazes/sample' by default.
  -H HEURISTIC_FUNC     choose a heuristic function for A* algorithm from
     			'zero', 'manhattan', 'euclidean'. This program uses
			'zero' by default.
  -v, --verbose         display information verbosely.
